# Social_Network
The Social Networking Console Application is a Java-based program simulating a social networking platform. It enables account creation, login, post creation, viewing, and interaction. User data, posts, followers, and followed users, is stored in a text file. This app lays the groundwork for a future GUI-based version with a server-side database.
