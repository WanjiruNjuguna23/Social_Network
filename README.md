# Social_Network
The Social Networking Console Application is a Java-based program simulating a social networking platform. It enables account creation, login, post creation, viewing, and interaction. User data, posts, followers, and followed users, is stored in a text file. This app lays the groundwork for a future GUI-based version with a server-side database.
# Features
Account Creation: Users can create new accounts by providing a display name, username, and password.
Login: Existing users can log in to access their account.
View and Create Posts: Users can view their own most recent post, the current post with the most likes, and the most recent post of each user they follow. They can also create new posts.
Follow Users: Users can follow other users to see their posts in their feed.
Interaction: Users can like posts and view lists of their followers and followed users.
# Data Storage
User data, including posts, followers, and followed users, is stored in a text file.
Posts are stored in an AVL tree, allowing them to be displayed in chronological order.
